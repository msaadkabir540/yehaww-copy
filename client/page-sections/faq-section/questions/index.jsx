      <p>
        For the first time there is a database of all people in the equestrian industry, where you
        can create a profile as an applicant and post a job as an employer for free. The website
        will calculate the perfect match for you to make a successful connection.
      </p>
      <h1>How can I find the perfect candidate on Yehaww?</h1>
      <p>
        Sign up for your employer profile for free. Choose between “Advertise a job” or “Find
        talent” on the title bar. With the instructions fill in the questionnaire with the specific
        criteria you are looking for in a candidate and post it on the website. As simple as that!
        When the job advert is posted, an alert email will be sent out to every person in the
        database that fits your criteria for the position, giving them the option to apply. There is
        also always the option to scroll through our extensive database of talent by yourself
      </p>
      <h1>How can I show I’m interested in a job?</h1>
      <p>
        Create your personalized profile online for free. Fill in the questionnaire with your
        specific preferences to let the database know what you are looking for.
      </p>
      <p>
        Start looking for a job by choosing between the two applicant accounts “Hands on” or “Stay
        clean” to find the position you are looking for
      </p>
      <p>
        Once you discover a job that seems interesting, simply choose “show interest” By choosing
        the “My Jobs” button in your profile, you can follow the status of your application. Here
        you can also answer any messages the employers might have sent to you.
      </p>
      <h1>What different positions might I find on Yehaww.com?</h1>
      <p>
        On our “Stay Clean” section of the website we offer positions such as accounting jobs,
        personal assistant, nanny, basically everything outside the barn.
      </p>
      <p>
        On our “Hands On” section of the website we offer positions in more close contact with the
        horses. Positions such as rider, groom, manager, driver and many many more within all the
        disciplines, would be found on the “Hands On” section.
      </p>
      <p>

      <h1>What do I get when I subscribe to the “Yehaww connect” account?</h1>
      <p>
        First you need to choose which subscription you would like to have. We offer a subscription
        for 3 months, 6 month or 12 months.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once subscribed you would have full access to the entire database of Equestrian talents.
        Which means you will have access to all contact details for everyone in the database, no
        matter location or status. You can also advertise as many positions as you would like.
      </p>
      <h1>What is the price for the subscription?</h1>
      <p>
        A subscription to our Yehaww connect account will give you access to all interested staff
        without any extra commission. “Pay Now” and get immediate access.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Yehaww connect account will be automatically renewed at the end of the subscription. The
        subscription can of course be canceled at any time by contacting us. You can read all about
        that in our terms & conditions.
      </p>
      <h1>How long will my advert be on the website?</h1>
      <p>
        From the moment you post the job, everyone in the database will be able to see it and show
        interest in your position.
      </p>
      <p>
        The advert will stay online for one full month, where you will have the time to get the
        contact details of all the people that are interested in your position.
      </p>
      <h1>What will happen to my advert after 1 month?</h1>
      <p>
        Once your position has been advertised for 1 month you will get notified on the website and
        via email. You will then have the choice to repost your position or maybe you already found
        what you were looking for.
      </p>
      <h1>The website offers Basic or Advance search, which one do I use?</h1>
      <p>
        In the “Basic” search you can look for information like years of experience, availability
        and location of staff.
      </p>
      <p>
        However with the “Advance” search you can go more into details such as what level of
        operation, visa requirements, skillsets, language and many more.
      </p>
